# Ruuter DSLs for public Common Services

## About

This folder contains Ruuter DSLs for public Common Services.

The repo itself only contains DSLs, not actual [Ruuter](https://github.com/buerokratt/Ruuter) application.

When deploying, DevOps/NoOps takes care of transferring these DSLs to appropriate locations.
